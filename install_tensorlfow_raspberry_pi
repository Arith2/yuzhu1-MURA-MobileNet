Actually, now it is not difficult to install tensorflow in raspberry pi.

Requirement:
1. Raspberry Pi
2. Raspbian 9.3

Procedure:
1. sudo apt install libatlas-base-dev
2. pip3 install tensorflow

Result:
1. we could see that the version of tensorflow may not be the latest, so we need to update
2. for version of CPU: pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow

Error:
1. If you meet some errors about 'h5py', then this command may help: 'sudo apt-get install python3-h5py'
2. Preinstall some packages may help solve the problem
